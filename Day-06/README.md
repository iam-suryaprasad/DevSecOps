# Day 06: Functions and Scripts
Overview
In this session, we explore the concept of functions in shell scripting and how they can be beneficial in managing code effectively. While functions might not be heavily utilized in shell scripting, they become crucial when you transition to languages like Python.

## What is a Function?
A function is a block of code that can be called whenever needed. It allows for code reuse and better organization.

Example in Python
def addition(a, b):  # Passing two parameters: a and b
    return a + b  # Returns the sum of a and b

## Calling the function
result_a = addition(2, 3)
result_b = addition(4, 5)
result_c = addition(10, 20)

print(result_a + result_b + result_c)  # Outputs the sum of all results
Importance of Functions
Functions will only execute when they are called. For instance, in Terraform, you might use functions like:

count = 3 
element
length
Installing Docker
To install Docker, you would typically call a function from a script like this: Docker Installation.

## Defining Functions in Shell Scripting
In shell scripting, you can define functions in two ways:

Using the function keyword:

function hello {
    # code
}
Using parentheses:

hello() {
    # code
}
Checking Installed Commands
You can check if a command is installed using:

command -v jq
echo $?  # Returns the exit status of the last command

command -v aq
echo $?
If the command_exist function wasn’t used, you would need to enter these commands multiple times in your script, making functions very useful for reducing redundancy.

## Running the Delete Volume Scripts
Create three 1 GB EBS volumes.
To automate this task daily, we’ll use Cron Jobs.
Understanding Cron Jobs
To set up a Cron job, you would:

crontab -e  # Edit the crontab file
# Add the following line:
* * * * * sudo bash /root/deleteebs.sh us-east-1  # Adjust timing as needed
Ensure that your script is saved at /root/deleteebs.sh.

Scheduling Adjustments
If you want the task to run every 10 minutes, use:

*/10 * * * * sudo bash /root/deleteebs.sh us-east-1
## Nginx Server Installation and Test
Install the Nginx server on your instance.

Access it and generate a simple HTML game:

nano /var/www/html/index.html  # Make your changes here
Set up uptime monitoring with StatusCake:

Log in with Google.
Create a new uptime test with the URL and desired parameters.
Calling Multiple Functions
In your script, you can call multiple functions. At the end of your script, you might have:

vpc $@  # Allows passing multiple regions
Interview Question Example
Question: In one system, how can I find files larger than 10 MB?

Answer: You can list files and check their sizes with du, but using the find command is more efficient:

find / -size +50M -size -60M 2>/dev/null
##  Explanation:
/: The starting directory for the search (root).
-size +50M: Finds files larger than 50 MB.
-size -60M: Finds files smaller than 60 MB.
2>/dev/null: Redirects error messages (e.g., permission denied) to /dev/null.
## Log Rotation Script
Log rotation helps manage log files by preventing them from growing indefinitely. When log files reach a certain size, the rotation script will execute to keep things organized.
